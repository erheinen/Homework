ELLIE HEINEN

Hi, my name is Ellie Heinen. My roots are in the Humanities, specifically philosophy and ancient languages, which are reflected in my Bachelors Degree.
I am currently working in Business Development for a small technology company, where mentors uncovered my passion for data-driven decision making and storytelling.
In the future, I see myself at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Linguistics - using Data Science to investigate the mysteries of human language.

My goals for the DAP course are:
(1) Become proficient in Data Analytics & Python such that I can work on a contract.
(2) Develop a career plan to get me from here to my desired outcome: NLP.
(3) Create a clean, compelling Capstone project and presentation.

Henrietta Leavitt (1868-1921) was an astronomer at the Harverd College Observatory, but her genius was not recognized at first.
Her intelligence and sharp wit landed her a job as a "Computer," which at the time was a (usually female) employee that performed various calculations for astronomers.
Through her work, she began to detect patterns - she recognized a planet's distance from earth could be measured by paying special attention to its lunminosity and periods.
Today, we know this concept as the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables.
Henrietta was not taken seriously at first due to her gender, and she received little recognition by the time she died young.
But her story lives on and inspires me to dream bigger than the box society puts me in.
